MATH-517 Project

### Data Description ###
We conducted data exploration, analysis, and visualization on a dataset conttaining information from a dataset containing information about more than 40,000 movies dating back all the way to the nineteenth century!
This dataset has lots of interesting information, but for the purposes of our analysis, we are only interested in thirteen parameters:

* Movie title
* Budget
* Genre
* Language
* Popularity
* Production company
* Country of production
* Release date
* Revenue generated
* Length of movie (runtime)
* Movie score from 1 - 10 based on reviews from viewers
* Number of viewers who reviewed the movie, resulting in the above score

Throughout this project, we will attempt to analyze the effect of these parameters on each other (e.g. Which genre generated the most revenue in the 20th century?)



### Areas of Interest ###

After exploring the data, the following questions about the data have raised our curiosity:
1. How is the revenue generated by a movie related to its budget?
2. Movies of which languages have the highest rating?
3. Over time, how has the runtime of movies changed (i.e. Are movies getting longer or shorter?)
4. Which companies produce the most popular movies?
